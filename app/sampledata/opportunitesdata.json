    "informationOne": "This project explores how people form attitudes about immigration policies. While immigration is a critical policy issue in America and beyond,  researchers often disagree about what factors truly drive individual attitudes towards open or closed immigration policies. A better understanding of these factors can potentially help policy makers more effectively design policies to benefit society. In this study you will be asked whether you support or oppose certain immigration-related foreign policies, and will be invited to elaborate on how you formed your opinions.",
